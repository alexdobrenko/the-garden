# ok so this is the second day

Do I even want to do this daily? I don't know. God not knowing is brutal. But also sort of everything. It is the ultimate thing to accept. That you do not know. So ok, like do I make that a THING? A page: [[not knowing]]. 

I just made the double brackets on it, but now I need to actually go and create a new document called Not Knowing. 

I actually just spent 5 min trying to figure out if there's an automatic way to do that which I think is a key thing I want to avoid lol - like spending 30 min doing something to save 1 second is, sadly!, not the best use of time. This is something Cal Newport talks alot about in his podcast.
