Creating this for myself to remember the various commands that you need to use in git and what they do. 

## adding stuff

You add the changes to the repo. Then you commit those changes. Then you push those changes up into the great big cloud in the sky. 

so its add --> commit --> push, and here are the actual commands. 

git add .
git commit -m "add a message here"
git push

## grabbing stuff from the internet repo

git pull
