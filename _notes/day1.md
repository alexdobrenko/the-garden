# Day 1 - Aug 15, 2022

I was trying to figure out the organizational structure for even using this thing, then realized that figuring that out in public is sort of the whole point. 

I love how the phrase 'in public' automatically makes me think of sex acts, like 'sex in public' is the first thing my brain can attach that phrase to 
which makes all of this feel a lot more scandelous than it is. "oh my god did you hear about Alex, he's *thinking in public.*"

One thing I wonder right off the bat is if I make a reference to a diff page here, will that page be automatically created? Let's try: [[don't try to force it]]. Ok btw, that did NOT work. So I would need to, when making a link to a page that didn't exist ALSO go ahead and create that page. Cool? Feels like there's a way to get around that, some sort of wild keyboard shortcut or something but I am not Advanced or Genius enough to pull that off yet, nor would I want to.

Ok but like, so I'm sitting here and reading this interview I found with a dude named Adam Curtis - [In conversation with Adam Curtis: Part Two])https://www.e-flux.com/journal/33/68302/in-conversation-with-adam-curtis-part-ii/) and its...really good. There is some stuff I would definitely want to, I guess, add to this database? But like, what? And why? I could, I guess, just create a page for every article I read but ...that feels like a lot? But maybe not, idk. 
-->this might be the kind of thing you figure out over time, with experimentation. 

Ok fine, so I'll do it -
