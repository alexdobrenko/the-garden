Am  learning a lot about the history and ethos of digital gardens. This in and of itself would be good to put publicly in MY garden. Like what have I learned: 

- Realizations about maintaining this
    - 

- General thoughts 
    - It does seem like the big craze for all of this was in 2020 and early 2021 - I do wonder if it is still as active or if this was more of a 'something to do during covid' lol
- Well there are some awesome examples of gardens 
    - [Maggie Appleton's Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) 
        - beautiful and incredibly well thought through
        - filtered by 'growth stage' 
- Ways to build gardens 
    - [Roam.garden](https://roam.garden/) - allows you to mark certain pages in your Roam as 'public' and then those will be added to a garden layout
        - Seems to be limited on the visual side of what you are able to do 
            -  [example of a roam.garden from Vlad](https://vlad.roam.garden/), the creator of roam.garden
