# What in the heck 

It looks like I've got a local version of this garden up and running which is frankly insane. Took less than an hour but that's because I am a coding phenom by which I mean the entire guide is [here](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll). 

Anyways. I guess what I have to do now is just start to....populate this thing. Is it even for other people or just for me. Don't know just yet.

But I can say that I feel a sense of excitement from creating something. Like this didn't exist and now it does. And I feel like I have a knack for building things like it. It just has always made some sense to me. Does that mean it will be easy? Fuck no. 

I do wonder about how to link things. Looks like that's actually already laid out (attempt at linking) here in [[cats]]
