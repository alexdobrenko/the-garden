dang ok so...I am sitting here on Nov 25 2022. Yesterday I decided to dive back into my project of creating a digital garden, something I've wanted to do forever and that I gave a real effort at in Sept of this year at which point I was making some great progress on figuring out the right way - nay, the perfect way -- to store all of my briliant but obviously still in progress notes. I made a few notes too like these:

* (figure out how to link to pages)

More than that though, I wanted to have the perfect container, the perfect plot of land for the garden before I even started. In fact, the most important criteria for success became: can I easily port over a select subset of notes from my private Roam database where I keep all my notes over to the garden. So say I read an article like "[Running a Paid Membership Program](https://craigmod.com/essays/membership_programs/)" and took a couple notes on it in Roam, which I did actually and here's what they looked like:

So I would, in this example, want those two highlights to be automatically synced with my public garden. And then I spent a month trying to figure out how to do that. Eventually I did, sort of, and then somehow completely forgot about it until now. 

And yesterday I tried picking it back up and was making a wee bit of progress when I decided to question one of the big assumptions I'd made about this garden -- that the notes from Roam needed to be coming in automatically. 

I looked at some of the gardens I really dig like Anne-Ness and Maggie and Tom and it seemed like for all of them, adding the content they wanted in there  was a manual process. 

Which makes sense! It;s a garden. Copying stuff automatically makes it feel more like a factory farm or somethiung, like why would you want to automate the process of creating and - most importantly - tending to your garden!?

**Faster and more automatic do not always mean better and deeper**

Thats the lesson for now.

Oh and -- when starting something new, dive in and do the work of it instead of obsessing over  how to perfectly present it to the world or whatever other non-essential aspect you're obsessing over as it is probably your brain simply wanting to not do the hard work of doing the thing itself.
