## thoughts 

Reading this after loving the [[The Anxiety of Influencers]] piece by Barrett Swanson. 
Dug this - I love the call backs to ancient mentions of baldness: 

> Baldness, by contrast, has long been associated with impotence, a bond that goes back to the Old Testament story of Samson, if not earlier. The Roman poets agreed. “Ugly are hornless bulls,” Ovid wrote. “So is a tree without leaves, so is a head without hair.” The only arena where bald men eke out a slight advantage is in the appearance of wisdom — cold comfort when you’ve been consigned to the phenotypical dustbin.

## great words 

Tonsured: "As a boy, I eyed my tonsured uncles warily, wincing at their scalps, revolted by the way their domes gleamed wetly on torrid summer days. But deep down I knew my repulsion was self-directed — that one day I would end up like them."

Defintion: shave the hair on top of (a monk's or priest's head); give a tonsure to.
"Louis's half-brothers were tonsured and sent away to monasteries"

Wow!! 

## pull quotes: 

One thing I’ve noticed, as my friends and I enter our 30s, is that it’s only the full-haired among us who have succumbed to the archetypal crises of early middle age. They’re the ones who moan about deepening crow’s feet. They’re the ones who take up Adult Study Abroad and think about buying sports cars. I’m inclined to think this is where bald men are truly better off. Because so many of us endured a seismic physical disruption in our youth, we now seem to rest more easily on the thought of our own mortality.

Which, in hindsight, does make balding seem an auspicious, wisdom-giving burden. To suffer that little death teaches you that there’s no point in battling something as inexorable as time, no point in mourning something as frivolous as a hairdo. Especially when there are even greater things — your sanity, your self-respect — that you’re still at risk to lose.
