## Thoughts & Ideas 
- What if I What if I did this. A comedian tries to become an actor / influencer. I could make it funny AND get the followers I need to actually get roles in Hollywood. It's SCARY how attractive and good of an idea this seems to be lolol. 

- K so this part is both provocative and scary and also maybe an overreach? Like, authenticity is never created in a vacuum - we are always defining ourselves in relation to one another, it just has never been so speedy and refractive via instant feedback loop. But does that make the tiktok kids less authentic? I don't think so. Nor is Swanson really saying that, just that the definition is different, though I do feel a sense of judgement, of looking down on the identity that is created via social media. This is where I think I might disagree. I feel a gut pull toward wanting to be optimistic and believe in the youth, to believe that they are and will see what is happening and become who they are because of and in spite of how they grew up on these devices. In other words I believe in the future and the youth who inhabit it, and I don't worry SO much about how, as many argue, their minds are being melted by the algorithm. This gives them way too little agency, resiliency, and faith. It's cliche to compare social media to how people worried about TV and about the printing press and even the telegraph. But its also true. Tomorrow's change terrifies the people of today, those already fading buttfaces  steeped like a bag of black tea in the water of yesterday's status quo. 

> That this is a chilling contradiction to the claim that TikTok is a platform for authenticity seems obvious. But I think the issue here is even more mysterious and complex. **^^After all, these kids were very young when their parents gave them iPhones and tablets—they’ve never known a self that wasn’t subject to anonymous virtual observation. And so it may well be that whatever we mean by “authentic” here isn’t the standard definition that Rousseau and the Romantics first fathomed—a true effusion of your unvarnished personality—but is “authentic” in the sense that their identities have been made in perfect, unconscious sympathy with whatever their mob of online followers has deemed agreeable and inoffensive. Several times throughout my trip, I think I can see the toll this takes on them, a kind of pallid desperation that flickers across their faces. ^^**At one point, Brandon comes over and says, “The scary thing is you never know how long this is going to last, and I think that’s what eats a lot of us at night. It’s like, What’s next? How long can we entertain everyone for? How long before no one cares, and what if your life was worth nothing?” Wasn’t it precisely this kind of sadness that my lectures on Keats and Toni Morrison were trying so desperately to foreclose? 

- I most relate to this bit below - like yes this is dumb but this is exactly what my notebook looks like: 

> Over Brandon’s shoulder, in a little dining area on the opposite side of the kitchen, the boys keep a whiteboard of their various working ideas. Among them are the following: 
hoops 
challenge 
desert video 
pranks 
skydive 
roasts 
tuxedos 
bath robes 
roommates control my day 
hide n seek

- Honestly in general what I feel about this is not 'wow they are weird' but wow they are me. Like this whole passage I have gone through so many times I cannot even count. 
> When I refresh the page, I see that one user named mskatiechilds has posited that “Barrett from Harpers is a star,” a declaration that is punctuated by a little nova-shaped emoji. And now through a web of harebrained connections to which I will not subject you here, I begin to suffer the delusion that in response to this video, Chris and Amir might recruit me, that, I don’t know, I’ll become some sort of in-house influencer professor or something, descanting airily about Plato and Foucault, spending my evenings fireside, reciting Plath and Longfellow. A vision overtakes me in the bathroom, of all the influencers sitting like preschoolers on the mansion’s carpet while I lecture, wearing tweed, lit by a ring light, as together we reimagine the purpose of “influencing.”

- This moment had me loling for real: 

> Even though we haven’t started playing yet, all the boys talk prodigious levels of shit. “Bud—who’s trying to get dunked on?” (DaeDae). “I’m a daddy on the court. Y’all know what the fuck is going on with me!” (Baron). “Yo, fuck that clip. Look how much height I have on you, fam.” (Christopher). I suppose I find it interesting that their Barnumesque hype-manning continues even when there are no cameras rolling. But a few minutes later, after we pick teams, something strange happens. ^^**For reasons I cannot identify, most of the boys scatter and disperse, wandering in the direction of the jacuzzi and pool, looking like left fielders distracted by butterflies. Only Baron and I remain on the court. “What happened?” I ask. Shirtless, dribbling at the top of the key, Baron sighs and says, “Honestly, man, this happens all the time. They all have ADHD. They haven’t been in school in like four years, and they haven’t had responsibilities, so their brains are fucking mush, bro. . . . It’s just like we pick teams for fun all the time.”**^^

- This is some grade A comedic writing right here - so subtle I missed it on the first readthru and then saw it and was like hahah that is good yes that is good. Such a powerful way to show contradiction with a mix of a quote + a fact (both irrefutable) - he did say that and yes he is 19. 

>^^“When I was younger,” Brandon, who is nineteen^^, says, “I didn’t have this much perspective on the world. I didn’t get to see everyone’s opinions on things. What was it? Just the news? Facebook? As a kid, I didn’t have a TikTok. I wasn’t an eight-year-old kid with a TikTok seeing what everyone else is seeing. Now everyone feels like they have a voice, and I think that’s what people are afraid of.” “Wait,” I say. “Who do you think is afraid?” “The government,” Brandon says. “You think the government is scared?” I ask. “Yeah, because on TikTok we have voices,” Brandon says. “We’re a whole nation of voices. That shit’s scary.”

- This insight shook me to my core and I may never recover but whatever lol

> At this point, I nonchalantly inquire as to whether Chase could maybe brandish his smartphone and pull up the video in question, and I’m soon made to view something called “Out of Shadows,” which has been posted on YouTube by an account called—I shit you not—Thinqing QAnon. Later, when I ask Chase whether he’s ever heard about the QAnon conspiracy, he says no, but explains that the video must be legit because “it’s gotten deleted multiple times off the internet, which is insane.” **Epistemologically, this is where we are as a country: when content gets expurgated because of blatant misinformation, it is taken as a sure sign of that source’s truthfulness.**

- Love the nod to Walter Benjamin who I only know cuz my pal Jack Mayer wrote a screenplay all about the essay that's mentioned here: 
> Not to sound like an English professor or anything, but as a professor of English, I can’t help thinking of Walter Benjamin’s “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” **Benjamin suggests that fascistic governments aim to maintain the status quo by providing citizens with the means to express themselves aesthetically without reforming their lives materially. Thus the aforementioned government that Brandon thinks TikTokers have scared shitless actually, as Benjamin writes, “sees its salvation in granting expression to the masses—but on no account granting them rights.”** More to the point, any countercultural voltage these influencers purport to possess gets nullified by the fact that they have clear incentives not to talk about controversial matters, lest they get dropped by their brands. “I don’t talk about politics at all,” Brandon says. “It’s like there’s always another opinion. It’s always better to be neutral. I feel like everybody avoids politics on social media. Besides that, though, everyone feels like they have a voice.”




- How can 23% of all ppl between 13 and 38 think they are social media influencers? I mean, am I?
