# Welcome To Sash's Garden ðŸŒ±

My name is Sash but most people call me Alex. Or wait, maybe its the other way around - My name is Alex but most people call me Sash.

Either way, this here is what the kids are calling a [[digital garden]]. 

The idea is to learn out loud, work out loud, whatever. I don't really know what it is and I don't really know why I'm doing it other than it has always fascinated me and when I'm working on it everything else fades away and I forget time exists and according to a man whose lat name is the same as his first name, that is a [[flow state]].

  I hope to use this as a playground sandbox fuck around zone for the ideas thoughts and feelings I eventually write more thought through essays on in my newsletter <a href="http://botharetrue.substack.com">Both Are True</a>.

  Have no idea who I am? Me neither. Some semblance of my 'wow look at his cool stuff' can be found on <a href="http://www.alexdobrenko.com">my website here</a> You can also contact me there.
